# SQL Case Study Projects
The projects are to showcase how I practice writting SQL queries to solve different problems.
PostgreSQL is used.

# Project Description
The projects are separate and not related to each other.
Each project is named as "name_case-study-no.number", for example, "painting_case-study-no.1", "covid-data_case-study-no.2".
Each project has the form of a big folder (with name as described above) which comprises a small folder and a SQL file.
The small folder is named "tables" and contains data tables used for the project. The data tables are stored as *csv. files. Each file is one data table. The files are related to each other. When clicked, the files are opened and ready for view.
The SQL file contains questions and SQL codes. It is stored as an SQL file. When clicked, the file is opened and ready for view.

# Project Process
In the beginning of each project, a dataset is downloaded from either Kaggle or Our World in Data.
Questions are created for the purpose of exploring data from different angles.
Codes are written to solve the questions.
Codes and questions are saved together as an SQL file.
The SQL file and data tables are uploaded into Github, "SQL Projects" repository.
A project has been completed.
