# SQL-case-study-projects
The projects are to showcase how I practice writting SQL queries to solve different problems.
PostgreSQL is used.

# Project description
Each project is named as "name_case-study-no.number", for example, "painting_case-study-no.1", "covid-data_case-study-no.2"
Each project has the form of a big folder which comprises a small folder and a SQL file.
The small folder is named "tables" and contains data tables used for the project. The SQL file contains questions for solving and SQL codes.

# Project process
In the beginning of each project, a dataset is downloaded from either Kaggle or Our World in Data.
Questions are created for the purpose of exploring data from different angles.
Codes are written in PostgreSQL.
Questions and codes are saved as an SQL file.
The SQL file and data tables are uploaded into Github repository.
A project has been completed.
